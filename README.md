  This is a responsive website that was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through VSCode. It is my first website that I have made that helped me learn a 
lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have touched on these langauges before in class, but this was my first project utilizing these langauges. It made me
more comfortable with Git to allow for me to push all of the code to its own repository. It furthered my expereience with VSCode by allowing me to use
more addons to help with the coding experience.
